            <p>1931: A star is born.</p>

            <p>
                <strong> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
                2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
                president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
                came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
                development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
                technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                <strong> Career as a scientist </strong> <br>
                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

                <strong>Death</strong> <br>
                On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[84] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
                <br> <br>

                Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.
